I was running into difficulties managing this project on top of my finals and preparing for my senior design presentations. I apologize, but I did not get a chance to research and attempt the daemon portion of this project. 

I also am not entirely sure if this project is working correctly, but I did give it an honest shot to fulfill as many of the criteria you gave us as possible. 

I apologize for turning in incomplete work.
